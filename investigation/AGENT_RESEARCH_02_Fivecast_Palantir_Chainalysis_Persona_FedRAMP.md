## SECTION 1 — FIVECAST ONYX / ICE CONTRACT

### ✅ CONFIRMED

**ICE Contract:**
- Award ID: `70CMSD23FR0000145`
- Total contract value: **$4,186,180.50**
- Action obligation (initial tranche): $1,342,810.50
- Awardee: **Panamerica Computers, Inc.** (reseller/integrator — NOT Fivecast directly)

**CBP Separate Contract:**
- Award ID: `70B03C23F00001003`
- Total value: **$2,356,143.95**
- Also awarded to Panamerica Computers, Inc.

**Combined:** $6.5M+ across DHS for Fivecast ONYX. The "$4.2M" figure circulating in media = rounded ICE contract ceiling. Accurate.

Fivecast is Australian. ONYX is their flagship OSINT platform.

### WHAT ONYX ACTUALLY DOES

From Fivecast's own product pages:
- Searches news, social media, search engines, company databases, sanctions lists, dark web, data leaks, and blockchains — simultaneously
- "Continuous, near real-time data collection" across billions of data points
- AI-powered detection across text, images, video in 100+ languages
- Builds "digital footprints" from biographical data across numerous platforms
- Tracks "sentiment and emotion shifts" and assigns risk scores to individuals
- Dark web monitoring without requiring analyst specialist training
- Network mapping to uncover connections between individuals/entities
- Configurable "risk detector" profiles for specific threat types

The EFF: enables "automated, continuous and targeted collection of multimedia data" for surveillance of individuals based on biographical inputs.
A MuckRock FOIA request has been filed specifically on ONYX usage and evaluation.

### CRITICAL NOTE ON FOIA
**The reseller layer (Panamerica Computers) is deliberate opacity.** FOIA requests targeting "Fivecast" may miss records filed under the reseller's name. Search for Panamerica Computers on USAspending for additional ONYX-related orders.

## SECTION 2 — PALANTIR IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT 2025–2026

### 🔥 THE $1 BILLION DEAL — ANNOUNCED FEBRUARY 19, 2026

**DHS Blanket Purchase Agreement:**
- Value: **up to $1 billion**
- Framework agreement covering ALL DHS components (ICE, CBP, FEMA, USCIS, others)
- Allows DHS agencies to procure Palantir platforms **without competitive bidding** for each deployment
- Announced: **February 19, 2026** — one day before this research
- Covers commercial software licenses, maintenance, and implementation services department-wide

This is the structural move that makes everything else permanent. No more individual contracts to scrutinize. The lock-in is complete.

### OTHER CONFIRMED CONTRACTS

**ImmigrationOS — Primary Contract:**
- Contract ID: `70CTD022FR0000170` (visible on USAspending.gov)
- Value: **$30 million** (specifically $29.9M task order)
- Award date: April 2025 (prototype deadline Sept 25, 2025; runs through Sept 2027)
- Awarded as **sole-source** (Palantir cited as only vendor capable)
- Modified in support of Executive Orders EO 14159 and EO 13773

**ImmigrationOS Three Components:**
1. Targeting and Enforcement Prioritization — AI-assisted ranking of removal candidates

**Investigative Case Management (ICM) — Pre-existing:**
- Value: **$139.3 million** (awarded 2022, expiring April 2026)
- ICE has indicated it will be renewed **sole-source** — no comparable alternative
- **⚠️ ICM expires in 2 months. Renewal = inevitable. Watch this.**

**Scale:**
- $81M+ in ICE contracts alone since January 2025
- Total federal contracts FY2025: **~$970.5 million** (nearly doubled year-over-year)
- Government contracts = ~55% of Palantir's total revenue

## SECTION 3 — CHAINALYSIS AND TRM LABS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

### CHAINALYSIS — ✅ CONFIRMED

**Master Contract with FBI:**
- Contract Number: `15F06722D0000317`
- Awarded: March 28, 2022
- Type: Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC), 5-year duration (through March 2027)
- Total obligations to date: **$30.2 million** (fully obligated — 100% burn rate)
- 20 task orders issued March 2022–May 2025

**NOTABLE:** FBI's contract ceiling is fully obligated. This is unusual for an IDC. Indicates extremely high operational tempo, not exploratory use.

**Additional confirmed contracts:**
- IRS: `CONT_AWD_2032H820C00041_2050`
- Treasury/IRS: `CONT_AWD_205AE923C00010_2050`
- Agencies confirmed: FBI, IRS, ICE, DEA, Secret Service (USSS), SEC, CFTC, **FinCEN**, TSA, Department of the Air Force

**Federal pricing (December 2024 catalog):**
- Reactor (50 Named Users, all assets): $5.55M/year
- Reactor (50 Named Users, top assets): $3.43M/year
- Cloud Kryptos (50 Named Users): $735,926/year
- Professional services: $246–$250/hour

### TRM LABS — ✅ CONFIRMED

**ICE/HSI Contract:**
- Value: **$1,948,677** (1-year contract, ~2023–2024)
- Awarded through ICE's Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center
- Sole-sourced: "only vendor reasonably available"
- USAspending: `CONT_AWD_15F06722F0002184_1549`

**FedRAMP High Authorization:** December 2024 — most stringent federal security classification. Enables use in classified/sensitive environments.

**February 2026:** TRM raised $70M Series C (Goldman Sachs-led), reaching $1B valuation. Government contracts are core revenue driver.

**ANOMALY:** Both Chainalysis and TRM Labs are simultaneously sole-sourced by ICE for the same capability category. Legally possible under different specific justifications, but structurally notable.

## SECTION 4 — PERSONA FEDRAMP AUTHORIZATION

### ✅ CONFIRMED — Exact date, exact level

- **Date:** October 7, 2025
- **Authorization Level:** FedRAMP Authorized at **Low Impact** (Li-SaaS)
- **FedRAMP Ready at:** Moderate Impact level (separate, more recent — MORE SIGNIFICANT when it advances)
- **Marketplace URLs:**
  - Authorized (Low): `marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2504154395XL`
  - Ready (Moderate): `marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2504154395`
- **Assessment:** Completed by a FedRAMP-recognized Third Party Assessment Organization
- **Sponsoring/Authorizing Agency:** Not disclosed publicly
- **Products Covered:** Full identity verification platform — government ID checks, document verification, selfie/biometric verification, database checks, business entity verification, fraud prevention, case management

**What Low Impact means:** Authorized for federal data where loss of confidentiality/integrity/availability would cause "limited adverse effects." Standard for non-classified, non-sensitive PII systems.

**Watch:** Persona's FedRAMP **Moderate Ready** status is the more significant milestone. When Moderate is Authorized (not just Ready), it opens substantially more sensitive federal identity workflows.

## ANALYTICAL NOTES (WEIRD ANGLES)

1. **Reseller opacity is deliberate.** Both ONYX contracts run through Panamerica Computers. FOIA on "Fivecast" misses these.

2. **$1B blanket agreement means the $30M ImmigrationOS will look small.** The framework removes competitive bidding across all DHS. What draws down under this umbrella over 3-5 years dwarfs any individual contract.

3. **Chainalysis FBI contract is fully obligated** — unusual. High operational tempo confirmed, not exploratory.

4. **Two vendors, same sole-source justification.** Both Chainalysis and TRM Labs are sole-sourced by ICE for blockchain analytics simultaneously. Structural anomaly worth scrutiny.

5. **Persona's Moderate Ready > Low Authorized in practical terms.** Low is table stakes. Moderate is the threshold for more sensitive federal workflows, potentially immigration and law enforcement identity checks.

6. **Palantir ICM ($139.3M) expires April 2026 — in two months.** Renewal is inevitable, sole-source. Will run concurrent with $1B BPA. Structural lock-in complete.
