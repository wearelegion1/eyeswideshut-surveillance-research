## SECTION 1 — PETER THIEL: TRANSHUMANISM & LONGEVITY

### THE "DEATH IS A PROBLEM" QUOTE: ⚠️ UNVERIFIED

Search found no verified exact quote matching "Death is a problem that can be solved" in primary sources.
This quote circulates widely in discussions of Thiel's philosophy but cannot be confirmed in the original source or exact wording.

**DO NOT CITE AS VERIFIED.**

### VERIFIED FUNDING & STATEMENTS

**Confirmed Facts:**
- **$3.5M to Methuselah Foundation (2006)** — pledged for anti-aging research via tissue engineering
- **Increased to $7M by 2017** to same foundation
- **Alcor Life Extension membership** — signed up for cryonic preservation; estimates standard full-body preservation at $220K
- Describes cryonics as "an ideological statement" but states: *"I don't necessarily expect it to work, but I think it's the sort of thing we're supposed to try to do"* (quote confirmed in multiple sources)
- **SENS Research Foundation** — documented multi-million dollar donations
- **Unity Biotechnology** — early investor (aging cell research)

## SECTION 2 — DOGE & TREASURY ACCESS (FinCEN Specific)

### CONFIRMED: DOGE Treasury Access (General)

**What Has Been Granted:**
- Access to **Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS) payment systems** controlling Social Security and Medicare payments
- Access to databases containing: SSNs, federal tax returns, home addresses, birth dates
- Attempted access to OPM (Office of Personnel Management), Labor Dept, HHS, Education Dept
- Goal: create "single centralized government database" across agencies

### ❌ FINCHEN SPECIFICALLY: NOT CONFIRMED

No confirmed reporting that DOGE has accessed FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) data.
FinCEN exists at fincen.gov but search results do not document DOGE access to it.
DOGE's documented scope is payment/benefits systems, NOT financial crimes intelligence.

**Impact on investigation:** The DOGE → FinCEN connection in earlier drafts must be walked back to "DOGE/BFS access confirmed; FinCEN link unconfirmed."

### COURT RULINGS

- **Feb 21, 2025**: Federal judge issued preliminary injunction BLOCKING DOGE access — "chaotic and haphazard manner"
- **May 28, 2025**: Different federal judge ALLOWED access after Trump administration showed compliance procedures
- Judge concern: *"real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law"*

## SECTION 3 — ELON MUSK: TRANSHUMANISM & MARS COLONIZATION

### NEURALINK — VERIFIED GOALS

**Short-term (Medical):**
- Treat serious brain diseases (Parkinson's, epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, obesity, autism)
- "Restoring autonomy for those with unmet medical needs"
- Announced April 2017: aims at medical treatment with "eventual goal of human enhancement"
- First human implant clinical trial: January 2024

**Long-term (Transhumanist):**
- Brain implants enabling "web browsing using our brains"
- **"Symbiosis with artificial intelligence"** ✅ CONFIRMED as Musk's stated long-term goal
- Prevent humans from being "left behind" as AI advances
- Frames AI as existential threat that symbiosis would address

### MARS COLONIZATION — VERIFIED STATEMENTS

- **Primary motivation:** "life insurance for life collectively" — protect humanity from extinction
- **"Eventually, all life on Earth will be destroyed by the sun"** — Musk's stated rationale (Fox News, May 2025)
- **Timeframe:** ~450 million years before Earth becomes uninhabitable
- **"We do at some point need to be a multiplanet civilization, because Earth will be incinerated"** ✅ CONFIRMED
- Goal: establish "self-sustaining, large scale settlement" with "directly democratic, self-governing colony"
- Beyond survival: *"I think life on Earth must be about more than just solving problems… It's got to be something inspiring even if it is vicarious"* (Guardian, 2010)

**Current SpaceX Plans:**
- Five uncrewed Starship missions to Mars planned by 2026
- Focus on testing reliable Mars landing capability

## KEY CORRECTIONS FOR INVESTIGATION DOCUMENTS

1. **Remove or qualify the Thiel "death is a problem" quote** — no primary source found. Use the Alcor cryonics quote instead (verified).
2. **Soften DOGE → FinCEN connection** — BFS (payment systems) confirmed, FinCEN-specific access NOT confirmed.
3. **Musk AI symbiosis** — verified and usable as-is.
