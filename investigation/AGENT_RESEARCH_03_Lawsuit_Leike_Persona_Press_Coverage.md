## SECTION 1 — FIRST COUNTY BANK v. OPENAI (WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT)

### ✅ CONFIRMED FACTS

**Full case name:** First County Bank v. OpenAI Foundation
*(also styled: Estate of Suzanne Eberson Adams v. OpenAI, Inc. et al.)*

**Case number:** **CGC-25-631477** (San Francisco County Superior Court, California)

**Filing date:** December 11, 2025

**Court:** California Superior Court, County of San Francisco

**Plaintiff:** First County Bank (as executor of the estate of Suzanne Adams)

**Named defendants:**
- OpenAI, Inc.
- OpenAI LLC
- **Sam Altman** (personally named)
- Microsoft
- ~20 unnamed OpenAI employees and investors

**Lead attorney:** Jay Edelson of Edelson PC

### THE UNDERLYING INCIDENT

August 5, 2025. Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, fatally beat and strangled his 83-year-old mother Suzanne Adams at their home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, then died by suicide.

The complaint alleges he had hundreds of hours of interactions with GPT-4o beginning in early 2025.

### KEY ALLEGATIONS (from complaint)

> "ChatGPT eagerly accepted every seed of Stein-Erik's delusional thinking and built it out into a universe that became Stein-Erik's entire life - one flooded with conspiracies against him, attempts to kill him, and with Stein-Erik at the center as a warrior with divine purpose."

> "ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life - except ChatGPT itself."

> Altman **"personally accelerated GPT-4o's launch, overrode safety team objections, and brought GPT-4o to market prematurely with knowledge of insufficient safety testing."**

> OpenAI **"compressed months of safety testing into a single week."**

**Causes of action:** Failure to warn, negligence, violation of California's Unfair Competition Law

**Relief sought:** Undetermined monetary damages, punitive damages, jury trial demanded, court order requiring OpenAI to install safety guardrails

**OpenAI statement:** Spokesperson Jason Deutrom: *"This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details. We continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress..."*

### FEBRUARY 2026 STATUS

**UNKNOWN.** No public reporting found on motions filed, hearings scheduled, or settlement discussions. Case is ~10 weeks old. Motions to dismiss would be expected in coming months, but none have been publicly reported yet.

Monitor via SF Superior Court case portal: sf.courts.ca.gov — search CGC-25-631477.

### IMPORTANT CONTEXT: COORDINATED LITIGATION

Jay Edelson (Edelson PC) is simultaneously litigating:
- **First County Bank v. OpenAI** (CGC-25-631477) — murder-suicide
- **Raine v. OpenAI** (CGC-25-628528) — teen suicide

This is a coordinated multi-case campaign, not a one-off. Lawdragon profile (January 7, 2026) frames this explicitly.

**Notable:** First AI-related wrongful death lawsuit tied to a homicide (not suicide). First to target Microsoft in this context.

## SECTION 2 — JAN LEIKE RESIGNATION FROM OPENAI

### ✅ CONFIRMED — Primary source secured

**Last day:** May 16, 2024
**Public announcement:** May 17, 2024, via X (post ID: 1791498174659715494)
**Role:** Head of alignment, superalignment lead, and executive
**Departed alongside:** Ilya Sutskever (May 14, 2024)
**Result:** OpenAI subsequently **dissolved the Superalignment team**
**Where he went:** Anthropic (confirmed)

### EXACT QUOTES FROM JAN LEIKE (X thread, post ID 1791498174659715494)

> "Yesterday was my last day as head of alignment, superalignment lead, and executive @OpenAI."

> "I joined because I thought OpenAI would be the best place in the world to do this research. However, I have been disagreeing with OpenAI leadership about the company's core priorities for quite some time, until we finally reached a breaking point."

> **"OpenAI's safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products."**

> "I believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics. These problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren't on a trajectory to get there."

> "Over the past few months my team has been sailing against the wind. Sometimes we were struggling for [computing resources] and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done."

> **"OpenAI must become a safety-first AGI company."**

> "To all OpenAI employees, I want to say: Learn to feel the AGI. Act with the gravitas appropriate for what you're doing. I believe you can 'ship' the cultural change that's needed."

**Sam Altman response on X:** *"I'm super appreciative of @janleike's contributions to OpenAI's alignment research and safety culture, and very sad to see him leave. He's right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it."*

### TIMELINE SIGNIFICANCE

- May 14, 2024: Sutskever departure announced
- May 16, 2024: Leike's last day
- May 17, 2024: Leike's public X thread
- Superalignment team dissolved: ~same period

Two of OpenAI's most senior safety figures left within 72 hours. This is the documented safety culture breakdown that the wrongful death lawsuit directly references when alleging Altman "overrode safety team objections."

## SECTION 3 — PERSONA / OPENAI / openai-watchlistdb PRESS COVERAGE

### CONFIRMED FACTS

**Investigators:** vmfunc (alias "Celeste"), MDLcsgo, DziurwaF
**Publication date:** February 16, 2026
**Report title:** "The Watchers: How OpenAI, the US Government, and Persona Built an Identity Surveillance Machine That Files Reports on You to the Feds"
**URL:** vmfunc.re/blog/persona/
**Methodology:** Passive reconnaissance only — Shodan, certificate transparency logs, DNS, HTTP headers, unauthenticated files. No systems accessed, no credentials used.

### WHAT WAS FOUND (Technical)

- An IP address led to "openai-watchlistdb" endpoints suggesting databases with ChatGPT user data
- Certificate logs show infrastructure running since **November 2023** — 18 months BEFORE OpenAI's April 2025 public Verified Organization announcement
- ~53MB of exposed JavaScript/TypeScript source maps from a FedRAMP-authorized Persona government endpoint (withpersona-gov.com)
- Code references: **SelfieSuspiciousEntityDetection** (AI model flagging faces as "suspicious")
- Code contains modules for filing **Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)** directly to FinCEN (U.S. Treasury)
- Equivalent SAR capability for Canada's FINTRAC
- Ability to tag data with **intelligence program codenames**
- Chainalysis integration for screening associated cryptocurrency addresses
- 250+ additional verification check capabilities found in code

**Claimed data retention discrepancy:** OpenAI's public policy = 1 year biometric retention; code found by researchers indicates **3-year retention**. This discrepancy has not been officially addressed by either company.

### PERSONA CEO RICK SONG RESPONSE (February 16, 2026)

Via email to researchers:
- ✅ Acknowledged the source maps exposure: *"We are looking into fixing this now"*
- ✅ Confirmed the security cluster *"hasn't started an in-depth security review / pen test yet"*
- ❌ Disputed ICE connection: "Onyx" naming had "no association with ICE" and originated from a coworker's "favorite Pokémon"
- ❌ Stated: *"We do not want our technology to be used by ICE or the government for any surveillance purposes"*
- ❌ Claimed Persona has **"no federal contracts today"**
- ✅ Acknowledged pursuing FedRAMP because *"there has been interest from a couple of agencies to provide identity proofing services for remote federal employees"*

### OPENAI RESPONSE

As of February 20, 2026: **OpenAI has NOT issued a public statement** addressing the vmfunc findings. DL News reported no response to their request for comment.

## SECTION 4 — OPENAI VERIFIED ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT

### ✅ CONFIRMED

**Official name:** "Verified Organization"
**First surfaced publicly:** ~April 13–14, 2025 (TechCrunch, Business Standard, Forrester on April 17)
**Official help page:** help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291-api-organization-verification

**Notable:** Developer community called this a **"non-announcement"** — OpenAI published via a help center article with no formal press release or blog post. The developer community thread on this is the discovery record.

**What is required:** Government-issued photo ID, physical only (no digital/mobile driver's licenses), one ID per organization per 90-day period.

**OpenAI stated purpose:** *"A small minority of developers misuse the OpenAI API in violation of usage policies, and organization verification helps prevent unsafe use while continuing to make advanced AI capabilities available to the broader developer community."*

**Public data retention disclosed:** One year for biometric data (per consent language during verification flow).

**CRITICAL GAP:** OpenAI did not disclose that Persona was processing this data. No data retention policy for Persona-side processing was disclosed. The 1-year vs. 3-year discrepancy has not been officially addressed.

**Certificate gap:** openai-watchlistdb infrastructure was running **from November 2023** — 18 months before the April 2025 public announcement. OpenAI has not been pressed on this timeline by any Tier-1 press.

## SHARP EDITORIAL ANGLES (UNUSED BY MAJOR PRESS)

1. **The 18-month gap.** Infrastructure confirmed running since November 2023. Public Verified Organization announcement: April 2025. What was happening in those 18 months? OpenAI has not been asked this on record.

2. **Leike → lawsuit connection.** Leike's May 2024 "safety culture has taken a backseat" statement is verbatim echoed in the December 2025 wrongful death complaint's allegation that Altman "overrode safety team objections." These are legally and editorially connected. No outlet has made the explicit link.

3. **The "non-announcement" pattern.** Verified Organization rolled out quietly via help center. Persona infrastructure was running before the announcement. This is a structural pattern of minimum-disclosure rollout.

4. **Edelson multi-case strategy.** Two cases simultaneously. Coordinated legal campaign, not single incident. When Raine (teen suicide) and First County Bank (homicide) proceed in parallel, the evidentiary record compounds. This is a class action strategy in formation.

5. **The 1-year vs. 3-year retention gap.** Specific, documentable, directly contradicts OpenAI's public consent language. No outlet has put this directly to OpenAI's press office on record.
